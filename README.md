# Code Summarization in Python
This is my implementation of a code summarization model for the Machine Learning for Software Analysis course of Università degli Studi di Firenze AA. 2025-2026.

## Installation
### Setting up the environment
First of all it's necessary to create a python environment. For this project I used Python v3.14.1. To create a Python environment you first need to have the correct Python version installed, you can then run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

You then need to activate the environment.
> Windows:
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
> MacOS/Linux
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing the dependencies
To install the dependencies needed you must run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
